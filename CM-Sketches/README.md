# CM-Sketches

A Simple implementation of CM-Sketches.
It's an efficient way to handle huge streams of data, with the purpose to return an approximation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_polynomial-time_approximation_scheme">FPTAS</a>) of the frequency of each element, without saving nor the stream, neither the single elements.
